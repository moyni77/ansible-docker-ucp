## What is this
This bunch of playbooks will install Docker Datacenter on top of a Simplivity environment using vCenter. The whole environment is created from a single temlate having RHEL 7.3 as the OS. It will install:

- A number of UCP nodes (typically 1)
- A number of DTR nodes (typically 1)
- A number of Worker nodes (typically 2)
- 3 load balancers (one for each of the above sets)
- 1 NFS node
- 1 logger node
- 1 ELK and Clodbee node (Still being worked on)

It will also create some grafana/prometheus containers to monitor the health of the system, an NFS node to store images, a centralized logger node (rsyslog) for all nodes and containers and it will set up backup policies for VMs and volumes in SImplivity.

The playbooks are meant to support a different number of nodes (ie. 5 DTR nodes rather than 3). You can also add new nodes after an environment has been created by adding the hosts to the `vm_hosts`(inventory) file and running `site.yml` again as described below.

The following instructions assume some basic knowledge on vCenter/Linux.

Also, please keep in mind that you need a Docker license (you can request a 1-month trial here: https://store.docker.com/editions/enterprise/docker-ee-server-rhel)

For the dev edition we've selected enterprise edition standard license, which omits image security scanning.

Capabilities that are provided by the enterprise edition standard follow: Container engine and built in orchestration, networking, security, Certified infrastructure, plugins and ISV containers, Image management, and Container app management. Image security scanning is only available with the advanced license. 

## How to use it
You need to manually configure two things first:

- A VM template
- An Ansible host

### Configuring the VM Template
Create a VM with RHEL 7.3 server, with minimal configuration and just one NIC. It requires just one disk (the playbooks will add a second one on the required nodes). Once the OS is installed, reboot and configure a repository. You can do this in three different ways:

- Connecting to the RHN network
- Creating a local repo from DVD (https://access.redhat.com/solutions/1355683)
- Using an external repo

Leave the VM on until you've configured the Ansible node.

### Configuring the ansible node
I'm assuming you're using a RHEL/CentOS server here but it can be done in other OSes too. Just 'translate' the steps below when required (ie. use `apt` instead of `yum` and so on).
- Install ansible : http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html
- Populate the `/etc/hosts` file so you can resolve the Docker datacenter nodes
- Run `yum install python-pyvmomi python-netaddr`. This is required for some of the playbooks
- Run `pip install cryptography`. This is required for ansible vault. You might need to install some dependencies first, including pip: `yum install python-pip gcc python-devel openssl-devel`
- Run `pip install pysphere`. Required to work with vCenter/vSphere
- Copy your SSH id into the template (`ssh-copy-id <template_IP>`)
- Clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/ophintor/ansible-docker-ucp.git`
- Edit the `vm_hosts` file with the right names and ip addresses to match your environment (do not modify the group names - ie. dtr_lb, etc.). The group names are ~~hardcoded~~ used inside the playbooks
- Edit the `group_vars/vars` file with your own environment details
- Create an vault to store your sensitive details like passwords, as follows:
	- Create (or overwrite the `group_vars/vault` file with the below:
	```
	---
	vcenter_password: 'xxx'
	vm_password: 'xxx'
	simplivity_password: 'xxx'
	ucp_password: 'xxx'
	```
	- Encrypt it by running `ansible-vault encrypt group_vars/vault`; enter your password when prompted
	- Create a file called .vault_pass containing the password and change permissions to 0600
	- Optionally remove it from your git list using .gitignore

### Complete the template creation
Just clean up:
- Run `rm -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*`
- Run `history -c`
- Shutdown
- In vSphere, right click on your VM and convert to template.

## Run the playbooks
From inside the cloned folder, run the playbook as follows:
`ansible-playbook -i vm_hosts site.yml --vault-password-file .vault_pass`
It should take about 30 minutes to run.

## Monitoring capabilities
One of the steps within the `site.yml` playbook will create a monitoring stack using Graphana and Prometheus. You can access the Graphana UI by browsing to http://UCP-NODE:3000.

## Known issues
- Your FQDN should resolve using DNS or else they will fail when trying to set up your DTR. A solution to this is either using your own publicly accessible domain or alternatively you could try this: https://github.com/bobfraser1/alpine-router
- If you comment all the env variables you will get plenty of warnings. To avoid that I have added a dummy variable that should be left there. I need to investigate a more elegant way to workaround this.

## TO-DO
- The playbooks will install a vsphere plugin so you can create volumes directly in your datastores, but for this you need to install the latest release of vDVS driver VIB. This has been done manually so far. More info: https://blogs.vmware.com/virtualblocks/2017/03/29/vsphere-docker-volume-service-now-docker-certified
